### Tools

- SQL Sever  - Data Cleaning
- Power BI - Data Modeling , Data Analysis
  
### Data Cleaning/ Preparation (SQL)

In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Exclude unnecessary data base on inspecting business demand to creat user stories.
3. Data cleaning and formatting

WHERE 
  LEFT (OrderDateKey, 4) >= 2021 -2 -- Ensures we always only bring two years of date from extraction. We could use GETDATE() function if we want to track it back from present day 
ORDER BY

```



### Exploratory Data Analysis (Power BI)

Data Modeling

Below is a screenshot of the data model after cleansed and prepared tables were read into Power BI.

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

- What is the overall sales trend?
- Which products are top sellers?
- What are the peak sales periods?

### Reporting

The finished sales management dashboard with one page with works as a dashboard and overview, with two other pages focused on combining tables for necessary details and visualizations to show sales over time, per customers and per products.

### Results/Findings

I have created all the dashboard that met all stakeholders business demands :
- A dashboard with graphs and KPIs comparing against budget which allow to filter data for each customer for Sales Manager
- A Power BI dashboard which allows me to filter data for each Product and customer for Sales Representative

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

- Invest in marketing and promotions during peak sales seasons to maximize revenue while decreasing budget spend on first quarter since sales is always dropping at this time of the year.
- Focus on expanding and promoting Mountain products .
- Implement a customer segmentation strategy to target high-LTV customers effectively.

### Limitations

I had to remove all zero values from budget and revenue columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. There are still a few outliers even after the omissions but even then we can still see that there is a positive correlation between both budget and number of votes with revenue.
